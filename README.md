## Known Issues / Incompatibilities
* Smart Medicine is incompatible at this time due to how it affects pawn's AI regarding medicine for treatment. Since mechanical units from this mod use repair stims as medicine and have a different system for medical related details, the two will conflict.
* Activating Self-Tend on a mechanical pawn will throw a message at you complaining that the Doctor work type is not assigned even if the pawn has the Mechanic work type assigned (It's harmless, mechanical pawns will self-tend based on Mechanic, not Doctor).
